leakage of data/buffer overflow. The system follows the Design from the service Blueprint which made this project easy to code. The algorithm developed are consulted from AI which helped catalyzed the project so long as the developer understands the python algorithms and knows the functionalities of each line of code, the developer can easily troubleshoot if the errors are encountered. That's why the comments on each line of codes makes it easy for those who may clone this repository so they can well undertand what each line of code does.

*NOTE THAT THIS IS THE PILOT PROJECT THAT WILL GO FUTHER MODIFICATIONS BUT THE DEVELOPER DECIDED TO MAKE IT PUBLIC FOR THOSE INTEREST IN PYTHON: DJANGO FRAMEWORK SO THEY CAN LOOK INTO IT AND BORROW CODES.*
